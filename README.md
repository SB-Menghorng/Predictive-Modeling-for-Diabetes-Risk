# Predictive Modeling for Diabetes Risk

## Overview
This project aims to develop predictive models to assess the risk of diabetes based on various factors such as age, education, income, and health behaviors.

## Main Objectives
- **Early Diagnosis**: Identify individuals at risk for early intervention.
- **Resource Allocation**: Efficiently allocate healthcare resources.
- **Public Health**: Aid in planning public health campaigns.

## Dataset
Derived from the CDC's BRFSS 2015 survey, the dataset includes 21 feature variables related to health behaviors, chronic conditions, and preventive services utilization.

## Models Explored
- **Logistic Regression**: Serves as a baseline for comparison.
- **Decision Trees**: Captures complex relationships.
- **Naive Bayes**: Offers a probabilistic approach.
- **Random Forest**: Provides high predictive performance.

## Evaluation
The models are evaluated based on their ability to predict diabetes status accurately, with a focus on recall to minimize false negatives.

## Conclusion
The analysis provides insights into diabetes risk factors and the effectiveness of different predictive models.
